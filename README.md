# `Oddle Test`

This project uses [react boilerplate][react-boilerplate] to quickly start the web development.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can install the dependencies:

### Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:3000/`][local-app-url].

### Deployment to Heroku

Step 1: Create a Procfile with the following line: web: npm run start:prod. 
We do this because Heroku runs npm run start by default, so we need this setting to override the default run command.
